This is the GitHub home of the Help A Charity, where local charities and Manchester Tech come together to make things better. For more information, go [here](https://www.techforgood.live/help-a-charity)

We believe many hands make small work, and want this GitHub Project to be a welcoming place for Tech folks to be able to contribute a little or a lot, no matter whether you're a seasoned pro, or totally new to programming, documentation, or tech in general. This should be a place for everyone. 

As such, you will find our [Code of Conduct here](). Please do read it. By contributing â€“ from code to comments and everything in between â€“ you are agreeing to the Code of Conduct. 

If you're new to  GitHub, check out 
- [mazipan/hello-open-](https://github.com/mazipan/hello-open-source) or 
- [firstcontributions/first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) 

which are both amazing introductions to using git and GitHub. 

For all new contributors to Help A Charity, please take a look at [NEWSTARTER.md](https://github.com/help-a-charity/Welcome/blob/master/NEWSTARTER.md) which outlines who key contacts are, how to be onboarded to a project, and other key info. 

- What other info do we want in NEWSTARTER.md?
- Do we want to use [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org)?
- Do we need some issue templates?
- Do we need Project templates?

Should we have a CONTRIBUTING.md file here, and/or in each Project Repo? This file would describe what type of contributions are permitted documentation/code/ideas/tests/examples/etc, Instructions of how to submit issues and label them, and then how fork/clone and submit PRs. 

What contributing style would be best? 
- Fork, clone, feature-branch, push, PR? or
- be added as a contributer, clone, feature-branch, push, PR?
